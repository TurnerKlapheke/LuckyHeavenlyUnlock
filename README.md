# No Lucky 7s Requirement

**No Lucky 7s Requirement** is a quality-of-life mod for the Steam version of [Cookie Clicker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1454400/Cookie_Clicker/) that removes the prestige digit-based unlock condition for the *Lucky* heavenly upgrades:

- Lucky Digit  
- Lucky Number  
- Lucky Payout

### ✅ What It Does

Normally, these upgrades only appear in the Ascension screen when your prestige level contains a certain number of **7s** (e.g., 777 or 77777). This mod removes that obscure restriction.

Upgrades still:

- Require all their normal **parent upgrades**
- Cost the same amount of **Heavenly Chips**
- Must be manually purchased after **ascending**

The only change is that they now **appear** in the Ascension tree as long as you own the prerequisite heavenly upgrades — regardless of how many 7s are in your prestige level.
